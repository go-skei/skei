# Skei - Version Control Made Easy

## Purpose

Skei aims to provide an intuitive document version control system that can adapt
to existing Quality Management processes. It is designed to be compatible with
ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 Quality Management Systems. Most importantly, it is
designed to integrate with existing, git-based software development workflows,
while remaining accessible for users unfamiliar with git.
